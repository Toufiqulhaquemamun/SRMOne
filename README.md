# SRM One ‚Äî Notes, PDFs, and Books

Isn‚Äôt it too much effort asking seniors or even classmates for notes each time you have an exam? Now, with semesters online most of the content you‚Äôd have to otherwise jot down is made available online in google classrooms across sections.

ü§î  **Why can‚Äôt it be consolidated in one place?**  	 ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*npLJLRVz9G2OVv1eht-5Xg.png?q=20)

Made available on request, sorted into semesters and ready to go instead of having to download all files to your device. ü•µ

We have built ‚Äò[**SRM One**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avstudios.college_app)‚Äô keeping all this in mind. Your one stop destination to avail all study material (Notes, PDFs and Books) to get that  **9 CGPA**  this semester.
